UltraX is a compiler that creates MDX performance files for Sharp x68000 MXDRV2. It includes its own small library for MDX creation.

Also included is libPyFMT (a library for FM patch creation/manipulation).


## Dependencies

UltraX relies on modules from Python's standard library (3.5), libPyFMT.
* Python standard library:
`ntpath, os, sys`

* libPyFMT:
`opmn`


## Goals

The following list presents the current ambitions of the project and if they are reached yet:

- [ ] Provide a MXDRV2 compiler on a modern operating system
- [ ] Provide a (built-in?) toolset with helping compose for MXDRV2
- [ ] Provide a way to convert DefleMask .dmf files to .MDX (+ .PDX)
