# UltraX â€“ MDX compiler for MXDRV2 

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-incomplete-red.svg?style=flat-square)
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-v0.1-orange.svg?style=flat-square)

UltraX is a compiler that creates MDX performance files for Sharp x68000 MXDRV2. It includes its own small library for MDX creation.

Also included is libPyFMT (a library for FM patch creation/manipulation) **[will be added later]**.


## Features

UltraX is split up into the compiler `UltraX.py` and a small toolbox `UltraX_Tool.py`. Globally, the following features are supported:
- Native Python compiling to .MDX
- Native Python compiling to OKI ADPCM + .PDX
- Supports all commands of the MXDRV v2.06+16/02EX specification
- Support for:
    - 1 channel ADPCM, PCM-4, PCM-8
    - Mercury-Unit
- MML text file compiling
    - Macros and pattern macros
    - PPMCK styled envelope macros
    - Extended compile time macros and commands
- DefleMask .dmf file (YM2151+SPCM mode) compiling
    - Support for almost every command
    - YM2151
    - Automatic SPCM -> OKI conversion


UltraX's core compiling system and toolset (pymdx) is written in a modular manner so that everybody could write their own compiler specialised in whatever way is desired. pymdx can create and export the following:
- MDX object
    - Header object
    - Tone definition object
    - Track data (MDX commands), individually per channel
- ADP object (OKI ADPCM sample, to be used in PDX objects)
- PDX object

*See the documentation for an indepth explanation of all functions included in pymdx.* 


## Dependencies

UltraX relies on modules from Python's standard library (3.x), libPyFMT.
* Python standard library:
`ntpath, os, struct, sys, wave`

* libPyFMT:
`opmn`


## Goals

The following list presents the current ambitions of the project and if they are reached yet:

- [ ] Provide a MXDRV2 compiler on a modern operating system
- [ ] Provide a toolset with helping compose for MXDRV2
- [ ] Provide a way to convert DefleMask .dmf files to .MDX (+ .PDX)
